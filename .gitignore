# (to @Sweaterdog) DO NOT ignore `settings.js` as it is a required file for the repo to function.
# If `settings.js` is put in the `.gitignore` file, changes made to do things like add new features - e.g. adding a new key to the file
# will not be pushed to the repo.

# Instead, when playtesting, run this command:

# git update-index --assume-unchanged settings.js

# This will tell `git` to ignore any changes made to settings.js.

# Then, when you have finished, clean up settings.js and run this command:

# git update-index --no-assume-unchanged settings.js

# This will tell `git` to start tracking changes to `settings.js` again.

# (To @uukelele-scratch) Thanks for the tips! it probably wont happen again 👍
